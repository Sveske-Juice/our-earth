## General game idea
This is a small management game for a school project. 
The general goal of the game is to reach zero emissions by some year. The user needs to invest money on different upgrades that influence a continent's yearly income and emissions.

### Things that can be improved, refactored or optimized in the future:
* Load upgrades from disk with something like Scriptable Objects or json for better scalability and modding support.
* Use sub-class for upgrades with special effect
