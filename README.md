## General game idea
This is a small management game for a school project. 
The general goal of the game is to reach zero emissions by some year. The user needs to invest money on different upgrades that influence a continent's yearly income and emissions.

### Things that can be improved, refactored and or optimized in the future:
* Upgrade system
* Use sub-class for upgrades with special effect
* Audiomanager
* UI Coding (opening menues etc.)
* Object pooling for creating upgrade ui elements (see fps drop in profiler when updating refreshing upgrade menu)
* Globe 3D-model
* Zoom and spinning of globe
* Prober savesystem
* Scriptable objects for saving catastrophe data
